# Uno Plus

We've built an automated and exciting card game, deployed on the LightLink Gasless testnet, and established a Blockscout account.

This game is strategically designed using cutting-edge technology, featuring cards that can be played if they're 1 point higher or lower than the current top card in the discard pile. Unleash special moves like playing a 1 on a 9 or vice versa. New players draw 2 cards, and the competition heats up as participants race to play all cards. Requirements: A minimum of 2 players to start the excitement, with an entry fee of just 0.001 ETH. Experience the strategic twists of Uno Plus!
